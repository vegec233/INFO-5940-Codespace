I first used ChatGPT to explain the different approaches shown in the provided Jupyter Notebook. 

While working on the assignment, I encountered an issue with the original template that used the OpenAI client setup. The error message “ValueError: numpy.dtype size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. Expected 96 from C header, got 88 from PyObject.” I wasn’t sure how to fix it, and even after asking ChatGPT, the problem remained unresolved. 

The features for supporting multiple and PDF file uploads were implemented with ChatGPT’s assistance, while the remaining features were completed by referring to the Jupyter Notebook, again with guidance from ChatGPT.
